# Record Entire Meeting using Pure JavaScript API!

This application runs top over `MediaStreamRecorder.js`:

* https://github.com/streamproc/MediaStreamRecorder

> It is NOT functional yet.

# Goals

* Record both audio/video from each user participation in a meeting room.
* Record all videos from all the participants.
* Merge/Mux then Concatenate using Ffmpeg on Node.js server
* Scale videos at the ended into a single grid-like stream so that later viewers are given single file containing all the videos and audios.

# Again, it is NOT functional yet.

> It is very close to single-person longest possible video recording. However please wait for new updates!
